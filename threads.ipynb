    "Python’s standard library has a queue module which, in turn, has a Queue class. Let’s change the Pipeline to use a Queue instead of just a variable protected by a Lock. You’ll also use a different way to stop the worker threads by using a different primitive from Python threading, an Event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the Event. The threading.Event object allows one thread to signal an event while many other threads can be waiting for that event to happen. The key usage in this code is that the threads that are waiting for the event do not necessarily need to stop what they are doing, they can just check the status of the Event every once in a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "The triggering of the event can be many things. In this example, the main thread will simply sleep for a while and then .set() it:"
